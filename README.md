# Themed-Wordle
An attempt to recreate Wordle with words drawn from a smaller sub-list, separate from the dictionary, ensuring each word is related to a given theme (holidays, fandoms, etc.)

## Points of improvement
While I did my best to make this as feature complete as I could, there are some definite quality-of-life tweaks that could be added, but would've taken the project well beyond the 20-40 hours
- Replace labels and buttons with graphical icons. That would significantly improve the visual appeal, especially if you added proper animations to handle tile transitions.
- Expand the dictionary. Even in my limited testing, the list I found online had some rather conspicuous absences, such as "pants" and "panda". I tried to fill them in as I found them, but if those exist, surely there are others, so there's more work that could be done.
